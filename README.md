# OIBSIP- OASIS INFOBYTE INTERN 
Got An Opportunity As A Java Developer Intern. I Have Contributed 2 Projects In My Repository:
### NUMBER GUESSING GAME (TASK-1)

Features Implemented: -
##### 1) Limiting Number Of Attempts - Only 5 Attempts In Every Round
##### 2) Adding Rounds As User's Wish - Users can Choose the Number Of Rounds they wish To Play At The Beginning Of the Game
##### 3) Displaying Score For Each Round - After Every Round Score Will Be Displayed
##### 4) Giving Points Based On Number Of Attempts - 
         1st Attempt - 100 points
         2nd Attempt - 80  points
         3rd Attempt - 60  points
         4th Attempt - 40  points
         5th Attempts- 20  points

### ATM INTERFACE (TASK-2)
Implemented 5 Classes in the form of nested
##### Main class - AtmInterface
##### Sub Classes - Deposit, Withdraw, Transfer, TransactionHistory & Quit
Only After Valid Authentication, User Can Access ATM Services. For Sample Case I Considered User details as
###### username:sai 
###### passkey :123 
I considered Only 1 customer details here. In real-time projects All the customer details are present in Big-Database Management System, which is not possible to implement here.
